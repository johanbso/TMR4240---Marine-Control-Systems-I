#TMR4240 - Marine Control Systems I

This repo contains the project reports in addition to Matlab code and Simulink models used in part 1 
and part 2 in the TMR4240 project. The goal of the project was to create a control system in Simulink 
for a DP (Dynamic Positioning) vessel, with a observer (Kalman filter or Non-linear Passive Observer), 
Thruster allocation (Pseudo-Inverse) and Controller (PID) in addition to mathematical models simulating 
the environmental forces acting on the vessel.
